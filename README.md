# Vault_SoftHSM2_Demo

## Install and configure Vault and SoftHSM2 for demonstration purposes

This is a simple script that will install and configure a single [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) instance as well as [SoftHSM2](https://github.com/opendnssec/SoftHSMv2) on an [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) VM.

A successful execution of the script should provide you with a [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) instance that auto-unseal using keys stored in a [SoftHSM2](https://github.com/opendnssec/SoftHSMv2) slot.
